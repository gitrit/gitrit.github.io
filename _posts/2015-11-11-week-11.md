Happy November! 

Week 11 was spent fulfilling the [Milestone 4](https://github.com/gitrit/pending/wiki/Project-Roadmap) requirements. We have been cutting out of scope ideas and trying to straighten out the remaining holes in our design. Due to the late nature of this update, accomplishments from Week 11 will be combined with the bullets in Week 12. 

This post will be updated when that post goes live on Friday.
