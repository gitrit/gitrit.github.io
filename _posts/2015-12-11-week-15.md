learnVCS has gone gold!!!

Instead of the usual breakdown of tasks for this week, I want to thank anyone who has been following or will see this blog in the future for taking the time to read all this, and to indulge in some back-patting. I personally feel that this project was the most successful I have ever been a part of during my time at RIT, and I am truly proud of the work my team and I have put together. Off the top of my head, I don't know of any independent studies that formed out of a common interest in resolving the curriculum gaps for future students as opposed to one's own missing pieces. It's a fine example of the good co-op does for the RIT community and an excellent case for student-driven involvement in what needs covering in the IGM program. 

The final release is as follows:

* [learnVCS - http://learnvcs.github.io](http://learnvcs.github.io/): A primer for version control concepts built with ease of use and responsive design in mind
* [VCS Lesson Slides](https://github.com/learnVCS/documentation/tree/master/slides/): Presentation slides in several formats that are ready-made introductions to version control
* [learnVCS Design Documentation](http://learnvcs.github.io/blog/design/): A comprehensive record of all the design and implementation considerations that went into making learnVCS

On behalf of the learnVCS team, thanks for checking out this project!

-Aaron Sky, Project Manager
