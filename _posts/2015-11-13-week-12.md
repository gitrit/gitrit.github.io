This week was spent fulfilling the [Milestone 4](https://github.com/gitrit/pending/wiki/Project-Roadmap) requirements. As per the update Week 11, this update will contain completed tasks from the past two weeks.

This marks the end of new features in learnVCS. We will be plowing ahead on cross-browser testing, editing and packaging in Milestone 5, creating resources and working with professors to integrate this into their introductory material.
